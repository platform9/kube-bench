5.2.8 Ensure that allowedCapabilities is not present in PSPs for the cluster unless
it is set to an empty array.

5.2.9 Review the use of capabilites in applications running on your cluster. Where a namespace
contains applicaions which do not require any Linux capabities to operate consider adding
a PSP which forbids the admission of containers which do not drop all capabilities.

5.3.1 If the CNI plugin in use does not support network policies, consideration should be given to
making use of a different plugin, or finding an alternate mechanism for restricting traffic
in the Kubernetes cluster.

5.3.2 Follow the documentation and create NetworkPolicy objects as you need them.

5.4.1 if possible, rewrite application code to read secrets from mounted secret files, rather than
from environment variables.

5.4.2 Refer to the secrets management options offered by your cloud provider or a third-party
secrets management solution.

5.5.1 Follow the Kubernetes documentation and setup image provenance.

5.7.1 Follow the documentation and create namespaces for objects in your deployment as you need
them.

5.7.2 Seccomp is an alpha feature currently. By default, all alpha features are disabled. So, you
would need to enable alpha features in the apiserver by passing "--feature-
gates=AllAlpha=true" argument.
Edit the /etc/kubernetes/apiserver file on the master node and set the KUBE_API_ARGS
parameter to "--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
KUBE_API_ARGS="--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
Based on your system, restart the kube-apiserver service. For example:
systemctl restart kube-apiserver.service
Use annotations to enable the docker/default seccomp profile in your pod definitions. An
example is as below:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: trustworthy-pod
  annotations:
    seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: docker/default
spec:
  containers:
    - name: trustworthy-container
      image: sotrustworthy:latest

5.7.3 Follow the Kubernetes documentation and apply security contexts to your pods. For a
suggested list of security contexts, you may refer to the CIS Security Benchmark for Docker
Containers.

5.7.4 Ensure that namespaces are created to allow for appropriate segregation of Kubernetes
resources and that all new resources are created in a specific namespace.
